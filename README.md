# Banking Management System (CLI – C++)

A console-based banking management application developed in C++ to replicate essential banking operations while emphasizing clean object-oriented design and data persistence.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a basic banking environment where users can securely manage accounts, perform transactions, and store records persistently using file handling. The application focuses on clarity, modularity, and real-world logic rather than UI complexity.

## ⚙️ Core Functionalities

- Secure user authentication using a PIN-based system  
- Account creation with unique user details  
- Deposit and withdrawal operations with balance validation  
- Individual transaction logs for each account  
- Persistent data storage using CSV and text files  

---

## 🧠 Design & Concepts Applied

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Encapsulation for data protection
  - Inheritance for extending account behavior
  - Polymorphism for flexible operations
  - Abstraction for simplified interfaces
- File handling for long-term data storage
- Use of STL containers for efficient data management

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C++  
- Concepts: OOP, File Handling  
- Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Practical implementation of OOP principles in a real-world scenario  
- Handling persistent data without databases  
- Designing modular and maintainable CLI applications  
- Strengthening logical thinking and debugging skills

## 🔹 Notes

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in C++ and system design.  
Inspired by common banking workflows and open-source learning resources.
